                    <p>
                        Every student has the ability to succeed, and it is my job as a teacher to guide them towards their fullest potential, regardless of whether or not they choose to pursue music professionally. I have high expectations for each of my students and demand a high level of excellence, but what I find most important is the journey of development towards each studentâ€™s successes. Cultivating their own musical voice is how each student will develop curiosity and creativity and discover their inner voice, their art, and themselves.
